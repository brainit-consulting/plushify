# Action Required: Plushify UI

Manual steps that must be completed by a human. These cannot be automated.

## Before Implementation

No manual steps required before implementation begins. All dependencies are already in place.

## During Implementation

- [ ] **Provide placeholder images** - Need sample before/after images for landing page showcase and testimonial avatars (can use placeholder services initially)

## After Implementation

- [ ] **Review legal page content** - Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Cookie Policy will use placeholder text that needs legal review before production
- [ ] **Verify branding** - Final review of colors, typography, and visual style to ensure brand consistency
- [ ] **Provide production images** - Replace any placeholder images with actual product screenshots and user testimonials

## Summary

This feature is primarily automated UI development. The manual steps involve content review and providing visual assets that cannot be generated programmatically.

Most implementation can proceed without blocking on these items - placeholder content will be used until final assets are available.
